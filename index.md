## Hi there, I'm Vic

I'm a software engineer based out of Louisville, KY. My primary focus has been in the web world working on Angular applications and the backend APIs to support them. I've also dabbled a little bit in the development of iOS apps, desktop apps, video games, and embedded systems. In general though, I just enjoy writing software. I'm eager to shift disciplines and expand my knowledge where I can. Feel free to browse [some of my favorite projects](/projects) for more specific details.

## Beyond software

#### Woodworking

As one of the most recent hobbies I've picked up, woodworking is also one that I'm least experienced in. Starting with youtube videos and a basic set of tools I started making cutting boards for myself, friends, and family. As I improved and built up my collection of tools I've started venturing into more significant projects. I'm always excited to show off the [entertainment stand and floor standing speakers](/public/EntertainmentStand.jpeg) I made.

#### Rock climbing

I started bouldering back when I lived in Salt Lake City and have kept at it since then. I've found it to be an extremely rewarding form of exercise. So far I've managed to top a handful of V7s.

#### Golfing

Golf has been a lifelong passion of mine. I've been through the somewhat competitive stage during highschool, but now choose to keep it casual. Once upon a time (when I was able to practice all day every day) I managed a few rounds in the 60s - a feat I'm proud of to this day.

#### Playing video games

If I'm not out and about, I'm usually relaxing with friends playing some games. My most played games are Rocket League and Valorant, but I also thoroughly enjoy playing through puzzle games and other single player games.
