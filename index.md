I'm Victor Johnson, a software engineer living in Austin, Texas. Much of my time is spent working as a software engineer for [Progressive Leasing](https://progleasing.com/), working on personal projects, and experimenting with new technologies.

If I'm not writing software, you can generally find me rock climbing at Austin Bouldering Project, listening to live music around town, or spending time with friends.
