## Hi there, I'm Vic!

I'm a software engineer based out of Louisville, KY. Professionally, my primary focus has been on full stack web development working on Angular applications and .NET APIs to support them. Outside the workplace, I like to explore other disciplines and programming langauages. I maintain a couple iOS apps on Apple's App Store, an open source modding platform for a video game, and some other miscellaneous projects. At the end of the day, I just enjoy solving problems and writing software. I'm eager to shift disciplines and expand my knowledge where I can. Feel free to browse [some of my favorite projects](/projects) for more specific details.

## Beyond software

#### Woodworking

As one of the most recent hobbies I've picked up, woodworking is also one that I'm least experienced in. Starting with youtube videos and a basic set of tools I started making cutting boards for myself, friends, and family. As I improved and built up my collection of tools I've started venturing into more significant projects. I'm always excited to show off the [entertainment stand and floor standing speakers](/public/EntertainmentStand.jpeg) I made.

#### Bookbinding

My favorite genre of book is science fiction, and a couple of my favorite authors are Isaac Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke, so naturally I find myself reading some beaten and battered paperpacks. I've recently started taking those paperbacks, restoring them a bit, and converting them to nicer hardcover books.

#### Golfing

Golf has been a lifelong passion of mine. I've been through the somewhat competitive stage during highschool, but now choose to keep it casual. Once upon a time (when I was able to practice all day every day) I managed a few rounds in the 60s, which I'll forver be proud of.

#### Playing video games

If I'm not out and about, I'm usually relaxing with friends playing some games. My most played games are Rocket League and Valorant, but I also thoroughly enjoy playing through puzzle games and other single player games.
